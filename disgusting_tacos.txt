# Disgusting tacos

DON'T MAKE THESE TACOS!

These tacos are disgusting and should never be done.

- Pull off your sock
- Make a hole in the tip of your sock, if there isn't one already (for best/wrost result, use really old socks)

Add stuffing to sock:
- Dry pasta
- Raw carrots
- News paper

- Seal sock up with duct tape
- Fry for 15 minutes

Done!
